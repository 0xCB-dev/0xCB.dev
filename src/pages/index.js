            After we saw how well recieved our 1337 macropads were, we quickly
            realized that we wanted to try something even bigger and better. We
            put our heads together and made a list of every feature we would
            want in our own dream 40% keeb, and after many hours in the lab
            we're extra proud of what we've come up with. We're very excited to
            introduce you to our newest addition to the OxCB family, the Static!

              In 2020, the 0xCB 1337 was our first foray into the custom
              mechanical keyboard scene. Now in 2022 we are doing an all
              improved version! The 1337 is a feature rich macropad, fully
              programmable with QMK and VIAL both of which are considered the
              gold standard for keyboard firmware! It features a rotary encoder,
              RGB underglow and per-key RGB lighting, not to mention a very
              snazzy OLED that displays information like your current layer/num
              & caps indicator/etc.!

              With the Pluto we wanted to create a small PCB that can be used by
              a lot of keyboards! We all know the keyboards that use a ProMicro
              or Elite-C as a controller drop in. The 0xCB Pluto is our take on
              that idea. It is fully compatible with the Elite-C but has even
              more pins exposed!

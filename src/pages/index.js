              Keyboards. You have 4 Layers on the Keyboard that you can cycle
              through. It features a Rotary Encoder from which you can control
              your Sound. On our OLED Screen, you can see the Layers your on and
              the RGB Settings. Our Keyboard also features RGB lighting at the

              Meet the 0xCB Static. After the launch of our macro pad, we wanted
              to do something bigger. So we made a 40% keyboard with an
              industrial design. This is an interest check to see, what you guys

                  <b>Great product! Great creators!</b>
                  <br />
                  I have been interested in getting a macropad for quite some
                  time now, but passed on all the ones that I saw until I came
                  across this one. I'm glad I didn't pass it by. The device
                  itself feels very solid. The print job for the case is high
                  quality. The aluminum encoder feels great and the click is
                  very responsive. The diffuser on the bottom looks very nice
                  and the default color shifting theme is a nice greeting when
                  you plug the pad in. The screen is very crisp and I already
                  love being able to see what layer I'm on at a glance. I can't
                  wait to create a custom keymap, so that I can integrate it
                  with my daily workflow!
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In addition to the device being great, shipping to the US was
                  much quicker than I anticipated and the creators have been
                  very responsive and a pleasure to chat with. They honestly
                  care how their customers feel about their product and about
                  the product itself. I would definitely purchase another of
                  their products in the future!

                  <b>Well Architected, Solid Piece of Technology</b>
                  <br />
                  Out of the box, this unit impressed us very much. Understated
                  on our busy manufacturing operations console, the macropad
                  screen provides the right amount of context to the tasks at
                  hand, and the case is well built and capable of the stresses
                  of a lot of use and 24 x7 shift operations. While it is our
                  belief that QMK was put on this Earth as a torture device,
                  fortunately this unit supports QMK's nicer little sister, VIA,
                  and makes programming and reconfiguration a snap. We are in
                  the market to replace a large number of macropad type devices
                  in our global manufacturing environment and were on the verge
                  of building our own, this unit is making us rethink that
                  strategy. Kudos to the two innovators who are behind this
                  project.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Of note, we don't hold the innovators at fault for the speed
                  of the slowest level of global shipping; we would encourage
                  them to offer faster options at the buyer's expense; from
                  Germany to the US, it was a little more than three weeks.

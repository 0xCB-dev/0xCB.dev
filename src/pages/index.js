          <p>
            We are Conor and Jakob from Aachen, Germany and we like to design
            and manufacture products in the electronics sector. We both are 20
            years young and are currently making our first experience in the
            designing, sourcing, and manufacturing of our 1337 Macro Keyboard.
            In the future, we want to make more products that we already have
            ideas for. If you have any ideas for us donÂ´t hesitate to contact
            us! We currently do not have our own online store as we use Tindie
            for our products.

              Great product! Great creators!
              <br />
              I have been interested in getting a macropad for quite some time
              now, but passed on all the ones that I saw until I came across
              this one. I'm glad I didn't pass it by. The device itself feels
              very solid. The print job for the case is high quality. The
              aluminum encoder feels great and the click is very responsive. The
              diffuser on the bottom looks very nice and the default color
              shifting theme is a nice greeting when you plug the pad in. The
              screen is very crisp and I already love being able to see what
              layer I'm on at a glance. I can't wait to create a custom keymap,
              so that I can integrate it with my daily workflow!
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to the device being great, shipping to the US was much
              quicker than I anticipated and the creators have been very
              responsive and a pleasure to chat with. They honestly care how
              their customers feel about their product and about the product
              itself. I would definitely purchase another of their products in
              the future!

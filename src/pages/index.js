          <p>
            We are Conor and Jakob from Aachen, Germany and we like to design
            and manufacture products in the electronics sector. We both are 20
            years young and are currently making our first experience in the
            designing, sourcing, and manufacturing of our 1337 Macro Keyboard.
            In the future, we want to make more products that we already have
            ideas for. If you have any ideas for us donÂ´t hesitate to contact
            us! We currently do not have our own online store as we use Tindie
            for our products.

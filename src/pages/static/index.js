              The keyboard will be available as a DIY kit. The kit will come
              with the plate for the switches, the bottom plate, an acrylic
              sheet to cover the electronics, the PCB, and all its electronic
              components including one OLED screen and a rotary encoder. Also
              included will be the 3D-printed feet and all the brass standoffs,
              screws, and rubber feet. As an added bonus you will get a
              3D-Printed diode bender so you can bend your diodes easy and
              exact. You will need to supply your own switches, screw-in
              stabilizers, and keycaps.

              The Keyboard sits flush on the table or at a 6Â° angle if you
              prefer it that way. It has a USB-C port on the back for you to
              connect it to your computer. With the rotary controller, you can
              control your volume and on the OLED screen, there will be info
              about what layer you are on and if Caps or Numlock is on. We also
              added a second Layer to the OLED that you can switch to which
              shows BongoCat which is animated when you begin typing.

              The base kits for the Static will feature black or white FR4
              plates. However you can get a stainless steel and aluminium extra
              to replace them with a higher quality feeling metal.

              The keyboard fully supports VIA and QMK so you can configure the
              whole keyboard to have multiple Layers, what macros you want and
              what the Rotary Encoder and OLED Screen should do, and many more
              QMK quirks.

              You have these five options for the bottom row:

          <b>Disclaimer</b>
          <p>
            The content of this site has been created with the greatest of care.
            I cannot, however, guarantee that the information in it is accurate,
            complete or up-to-date. As a service provider I am responsible under
            Section 6(1) of the German Media Services Inter-State Agreement and
            Section 8(1) of the German Teleservices Act for my own content on
            this site. Service providers are not however obliged to monitor
            third party information transmitted or stored on their site by them
            or to look for circumstances which may suggest a violation of the
            law. This does not affect my statutory obligations to remove or
            block the use of information. My liability in such cases shall
            however commence from the time I become aware of an actual
            violation. On becoming aware of such violations I shall remove this
            content immediately.
          </p>
          <b>Liability for links</b>
          <p>
            This website contains links to external third-party websites, over
            the content of which I have no control. I cannot, therefore, make
            any guarantees regarding this third-party content. Responsibility
            for the content of linked sites lies solely with the provider or
            operator of the site concerned. All linked sites were checked for
            possible violations of the law when they were linked to mine. At
            that time I was not aware of any content which may violate the law.
            However, I cannot be expected to monitor the content of linked sites
            on an ongoing basis unless I have reason to suspect a violation of
            the law. On becoming aware of such a violation I shall remove the
            respective link immediately.
          </p>
          <b>Copyright</b>
          <p>
            The operator of this site makes every effort to respect the
            copyrights of outside parties and to employ his own material and
            material in the public domain. All content and material on this site
            created by the site operator is governed by German copyright law.
            Downloads and copies of this site may be made for private,
            non-commercial use only. Reproduction, processing, distribution and
            any form of exploitation beyond that permitted by copyright law
            requires the written consent of the author or creator concerned.
            Contributions by third parties are identified as such. Should anyone
            become aware of a possible copyright infringement, I kindly request
            that you inform me of such. Upon becoming aware of such a violation
            I shall remove the respective content immediately.

          <b>Data protection</b>
          <p>
            As a rule the use of this website is possible without providing any
            personally relevant data. Any provision of personal data (e.g. name,
            address or email addresses) occurs entirely on a voluntary basis.
            These data will not be provided to any third parties without the
            user's express approval. Be aware that the transmission of data via
            the internet (e.g. communication by email) is subject to security
            gaps. Complete protection of data from unauthorized access by third
            parties is not possible. The use of contact details published under
            the statutory requirement to provide acknowledgements by third
            parties for the purpose of the transmission of unsolicited
            advertising and informational material is expressly opposed. The
            site operator expressly reserves the right to take legal action
            against the unsolicited mailing of advertising information by way of
            spamming or similar.
